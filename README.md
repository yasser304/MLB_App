=======
A project management tool creating using IBM Worklight. The UI has been designed using jQuery Mobile with a Javascript
adapter talking to the backend Connection API. The home screen provides a summary of the month with highlighted dates showing
when projects are due. Upon clicking these highlighted dates one can see the projects that are due and the person assigned
to it. The "status" tab provides this information in a listview format. The "incoming request" tab retrieves the new
requests made and displays them in a listview format.
